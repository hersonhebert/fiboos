\description{
The implemented function executes the implemented methods.
Using this function, it is possible to calculate occluded areas
through the traditional methodology, Occluded Surface, or by
applying the Fibonacci OS methodology. At the end of the method
execution, the "prot.srf" file is generated, and returned for
the function. The data in this file refers to all contacts
between atoms of molecules present in a protein's PDB.
